This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose typing.  The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's dynamic typing, it performs string concatenation when one of the inputs is a string. The solution showcases how to use type checking or explicit type conversion to prevent this issue.
